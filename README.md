# DmiStorageServer
Departement of Mathematics and Informatics cloud based storage server.

### Contributing 

The code must be psr-1 psr-2 compliance; 

The branching strategy is Github Flow; 

The commits must complete the following sentence: "If I pull this commit, I will [ commit_name ]"; 

### Basic Idea

The server will store a minimum quantity of sensible data

The storage content will be public

Every user can request permissions to: 

- Upload in a folder

- Upload & delete in a folder

- Manage a whole folder

Admins will handle the requests.

Every admin has whole permissions on the file management system, so he can: 

- Accept requests by users

- Create / Delete a folder

- Create / Delete a course

- Upload / Remove a file
